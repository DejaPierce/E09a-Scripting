In this assignement we added a number of lives, a score, and a game over screen. To play the game you have to destory the colored tiles by hitting it with a ball. You control the ball by moving the paddle side to side. If the ball falls to the bottom of the screen then you lose a life. If you successfully destory a tile then your score increases. If you die 3 times then you'll get a game over screen.
